# Feasibility-studies-for-a-Muon-source
This repository has been created to keep track of all the work done in the TPIV on the subject "Feasibility studies for a Muon source"

## First step

Our first step is to get the optical parameters (Courant Snyder) for a FODO lattice in an ideal case.

## Second step

We are going to find the emittance of a particle produced with an annihilation process (here a muon) in function of its optical parameters and the action and angle variables of the source particle (here a positron at 45 GeV)
